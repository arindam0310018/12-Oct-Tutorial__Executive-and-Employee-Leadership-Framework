# Executive and Employee Leadership Framework Applied in my Cloud Team:-

Greetings to my fellow Technology Advocates and Specialists.

Very recently, my company organized leadership training where we were introduced to a concept followed by an exercise of __“Executive and Employee leadership framework.”__

| __VENUE:-__ |

| __DEFINITION:-__ |
| --------- |
| To better understand this blogpost, the following definition will be useful. |
| __Executive:__ Any leader (Managing Director, Department Head, Team Lead, …). |
| __Employee:__ Reporting to a leader. | 

| __CONCEPT:-__ |
| --------- |
| __1.__ In this exercise, all leaders were organized into groups of five. The purpose was for each person to take turns acting as the Executive for the others. When not in the Executive role, each member would assume the role of an employee. |
| __2.__ Each group member was assigned a scripted situation and character, which they were expected to portray. The script was identical for everyone, so all participants were aware of each other’s character and situation, providing a fair opportunity to prepare for their turn as the Executive. |
| __3.__ As the executive, you will invite each group member, acting as an employee, into the room one at a time. Each employee will present their scripted concerns, and your task is to offer potential solutions that are acceptable to them, all within a 5-minute timeframe. |
| __4.__ At the end of the exercise, the group gathers to conduct a retrospective, reflecting on each member’s experience as an executive. |

| __TAKE AWAY(S):-__ |
| --------- | 
| This exercise showed everyone in the group  that employees often have numerous opinions about executives; until they step into an executive role themselves and realize the time and effort required to consider everyone’s viewpoints and develop responses that can be applicable for all. Once promoted, an employee no longer be an individual contributor, making the role quite challenging. |

| __HOW I IMPLEMENTED MY TAKE AWAY(S):-__ |
| --------- |
| __1.__ In my cloud platform team, we focus heavily on two main areas:- |
| __(a.)__ Developing, enhancing, and supporting Cloud Products and Governance. |
| __(b.)__ Delivering Cloud Projects. In both areas, daily discussions are abundant, and, like any team, we encounter a wide range of opinions on each topic. |
| __2.__ For Cloud Project Deliveries, this concept doesn’t fully apply since projects often involve just one or two engineers, drawing conclusion easier to achieve. |
| __3.__ However, when it comes to building, enhancing, and supporting Cloud Products and Governance, reaching a common understanding is more challenging. This is where I implemented this concept:- |
| __(a.)__ We are currently developing four Cloud Products and two Consulting Services. |
| __(b.)__ Each platform engineer in the team serves as an executive for one Product or Consulting Service and acts as an employee for the others. | 
| __(c.)__ This approach helps engineers build skills in delegation, collaboration, constructive participation, offering actionable insights, effective communication, and, most importantly, empathy toward their teammates. Without this practice, they may encounter similar challenges when they take on the executive role in a different product or service. |

__Hope You Enjoyed the Session!!!__
